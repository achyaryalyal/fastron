Font smoothing
==========================================
- open playonlinux
- configure
- select virtual drive to configure. ex: Office2010
- tab "Install Components", install the following option in respective order:
  - "Microsoft Core Fonts"
  - "Disable Crash Dialog" -> my personal favorite.
  - "FontSmoothRGB" -> this one is exceptionally crucial.
  - "LunaTheme" -> itâ€™s actually Royal Theme
  - "Tahoma"
- tab wine -> Windows reboot. Give it a moment, then you can test it by clicking at Configure Wine. If you are lucky, the fonts should be anti-aliased for now. Do not mess around much with the configuration, you are on own risk. However, I did switch the theme, tab Desktop Integration, theme Royal, colour Royal Noir.
