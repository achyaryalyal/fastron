# while waiting for WHM installation to complete for about 20 minutes, let's set up our own nameservers
# login to your domain provider client area
# choose domain, go to "Private Name Server"
# add ns1 and ns2 with your server public IP, save
# go to "Nameservers", input ns1.[YOUR_DOMAIN] and ns2.[YOUR_DOMAIN], save

# after the WHM installation is complete, ssh again and fix short time login
